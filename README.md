# ohlcv
logic.js contains functions which gets input data (ohlcv and calculated values like atr, volavg) from DB
and returns bullish/neutral/bearish (output).
Purpose is to "calculate": is it sell or is it buy (seems simple, but it only seems).

Why: I got excited (i was shocked) with chatgpt (the things it outputed to my screen) and started sharing.
