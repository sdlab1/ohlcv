# ohlcv
logic.js contains functions which gets input data array (ohlcv and calculated values like atr, volavg, sma, ...)
here's data[0]:
{
    "open": 19169,
    "high": 19522,
    "low": 19086,
    "close": 19488,
    "volume": 511.049,
    "time": 1666526400000,
    "atr": 199.97250000000003,
    "sma": 19164.26666666667,
    "volavg": 323.45472499999994
}

from DB and returns bullish/neutral/bearish (output).
Purpose is to "calculate": is it sell or is it buy (seems simple, but it only seems).

Why: I got excited (i was shocked) with chatgpt and started sharing.
