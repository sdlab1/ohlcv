Question:
compare 2 functions calls (as indicated) in case of data array of size 260.
1) How many assignments, summations, divisions in total for first and second call (including summations and divisions within functions).
2) Which call has less divisions.
3) Which call has less summations.
function 1:
function calcSMA(data, i, period) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let j = i - period; j <= i; j++) {
    sum += data[j].close;
  }
  return sum / period;
}
function 2:
function ma(arr, period) { //moving average
    let tmp = [], arrout = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
        tmp[i] = arr[i] / period;
    arrout[0] = tmp[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < period; i++)
        arrout[0] += tmp[i];
    for (let i = 0; i < tmp.length-period; i++)
        arrout[i+1] = arrout[i] - tmp[i] + tmp[i+period-1];
    return arrout;
}
function calls:
var data[260], period = 15;
1)
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
  let sma1[i] = calcSMA(data, i, period);}
2)
sma2 = ma(data, period);

Answer:
1. In the first function call, there will be 260 assignments, period summations, and 260 divisions. In the second function call, there will be 515 assignments and 390 summations.
2. Both function calls have the same number of divisions (260).
3. The second function call has fewer summations (390) compared to the first function call (period * 260).
