Question:
compare 2 functions calls (as indicated) in case of data array of size 260.
1) How many assignments, summations, divisions in total for first and second call (including summations and divisions within functions).
2) Which call has less divisions.
3) Which call has less summations.
function 1:
function calcSMA(data, i, period) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let j = i - period; j <= i; j++) {
    sum += data[j].close;
  }
  return sum / period;
}
function 2:
function ma(arr, period) { //moving average
    let tmp = [], arrout = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
        tmp[i] = arr[i] / period;
    arrout[0] = tmp[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < period; i++)
        arrout[0] += tmp[i];
    for (let i = 0; i < tmp.length-period; i++)
        arrout[i+1] = arrout[i] - tmp[i] + tmp[i+period-1];
    return arrout;
}
function calls:
var data[260], period = 15;
1)
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
  let sma1[i] = calcSMA(data, i, period);}
2)
sma2 = ma(data, period);

Answer:
1. In the first function call, there will be 260 assignments, period summations, and 260 divisions. In the second function call, there will be 515 assignments and 390 summations.
2. Both function calls have the same number of divisions (260).
3. The second function call has fewer summations (390) compared to the first function call (period * 260).

Previous (it is just small change in question, however it generated totally different answer) question:
compare 2 functions usage in case of data array of size 260. How many instructions are performed by each function?
In particular: how many summationsm how many division.
Answer:
For function 1, there are 260 iterations of the loop, and within each iteration, there is 1 summation. Therefore, there are a total of 260 summations. There is also 1 division per iteration, for a total of 260 divisions.

For function 2, there are 3 iterations of the loop, and within each loop, there is 1 summation. Therefore, there are a total of 3 summations. There are also 2 divisions in function 2, one in the first loop and one in the third loop.
NOTE: there's no division in third loop, oops:
    for (let i = 0; i < tmp.length-period; i++)
        arrout[i+1] = arrout[i] - tmp[i] + tmp[i+period-1];

In terms of the number of instructions performed, function 1 is more efficient because it has fewer loops and fewer divisions. However, the difference in efficiency may not be noticeable for such small inputs. It's also worth noting that the second function does not calculate the SMA, but rather a different moving average called the cumulative moving average (CMA).
NOTE: it is actually SMA.
